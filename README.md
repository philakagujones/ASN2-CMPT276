This application provides a straightforward user interface. On the home page, you can easily add new students by providing the necessary parameters. Once you have successfully added a student, you will be redirected to a success page. From there, you have the option to return to the home page.

To view all the students that have been added to the database, simply click on the "View All Students" link located in the top right corner of the home page. This action will display a list of all the students. Additionally, when you hover over a specific student, buttons will appear that allow you to edit their information or delete them from the database.
